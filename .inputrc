# Comments after commands are not allowed, so:
# convert-meta off lets รก produce \341 instead of nothing
set convert-meta off
# output-meta on lets รก produce รก, if convert-meta is off
set output-meta on
# input-meta on is the same variable as meta-flag, not sure what it does
set input-meta on

# Suggest completions when tab is pressed once
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# Don't wrap long lines
