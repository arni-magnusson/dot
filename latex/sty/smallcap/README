In prevision of the future release of DC1.3 fonts I have built an option
file and a definition file to have all 4 shapes of Small caps.
 This is "smallcap.sty" (none exists in the archies)
 and     "T1cmsc.fd"    (none exists in the archies)

\scshape => \undefined and replaced by \scfamily (SC becomes a family,
rather than a shape). Thus you can write:

\bf\scfamily\slshape

to get small caps bold slanted...
